\description{
A profile plot shows Log Intensity on the X axis and Log Ratio on the Y axis.
This function is intended to show the profile plot from a dataframe
in DGEobj design objects (i.e BDL_vs_SHAM).  Properly normalized data will generally be
centered around LogRatio = 0.
}
\details{
By default, the plot places "logFC" on the Y axis and "AveExpr" on the X
axis. By default, a reference horizontal line is shown at LogRatio = 0 on the
Y axis. Optionally, additional reference lines will be drawn at +/- a user
supplied LogRatio threshold. A Loess line fit is drawn through the actual
data. The points are color coded using the significance measure (i.e p-value)
supplied by the user. By default, the P.Value field is used
with a threshold of 0.01 to color code the points.

\strong{Data Structure for the input dataframe:}

The defaults are set for the contrasts on the DGEobj object (ie in BDL_vs_SHAM).
The columns named "logFC", "AveExpr", and "P.Value" are used by default to accommodate
the column names used in these dataframes.  Any other dataframe can be used with fold-change,
intensity, and significance measures, with appropriate arguments to define the column names
to use provided. By default, the column names will be used for the axis labels,
but can be overridden with xlab and ylab arguments.

A significance measure (which defaults to P.Value <= 0.01) is used to color code genes that
are significantly increased or decreased.

Sensible defaults are chosen for symbols (Size, Shape, Color, and Fill), but they can be
adjusted through the use of optional arguments. A length of 3 is
required for these arguments which applies the attributes in this order:
Increased, NoChange, Decreased.
