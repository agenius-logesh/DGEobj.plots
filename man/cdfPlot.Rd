\description{
CDF plots are a good complement to p-value histograms as a way to evaluate
model performance and examine support for differential expression. Results
are ranked by p-value on the x-axis and the p-value plotted on the y-axis.
Since p-value distributions should be flat, this type of plot should produce a
straight line.  Any observations that fail to meet the null hypothesis will
appear as a break in the line at the low end of the curve.
}
\details{
This function is designed to take topTable dataframes and display the
corresponding CDF plot. Data for the p-values below 0.1 (configurable via
pvalMax argument) are shown in a full size plot. An viewport figure shows the
whole p-value scale. Points below 0.01 are a different color by default
(threshold set by pThreshold argument; shape/color attributes customizable
through other arguments).

\strong{Data Structure for the input dataframe:}

The defaults are set for dataframes produced by topTable.  The column
"P.Value" is used by default to accommodate the column names used in topTable
dataframes.  Any other dataframe can be used with by explicitly defining the
p-value column name with the appropriate argument.

Sensible defaults are chosen for symbols (Size, Shape and Color).
There are optional arguments that allow these to be adjusted. A length of 2
is required for these arguments which applies the attributes in
this order: Significant, Not Significant.
